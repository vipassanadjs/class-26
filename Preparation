Firstly preheat the oven. You need to heat it to 175 degrees. Then, take the 3 eggs into a bowl. After that, add the sugar to the eggs and whisk for approx. 5 minutes. You need to have a foam-like egg and sugar mixture. Here, you can either use a mixer or a fork. After having your foam, you need to add milk to the mixture. Then add the oil and vanilla as well. You need to follow this order for a puffy cake. (Also, you can add cocoa as well. If you add cocoa, you will have a cocoa cake). Then sift the flour into the mixture. Stir until all ingredients are homogeneous and finally add baking powder.

Pour the prepared cake dough into the greased cake mould and spread evenly. Or you can use a springform pan to bake your cake. Bake the cake in the preheated oven for about thirty-five minutes. When your cake is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool. Finally, turn the mould upside down to remove the cake and serve by slicing.
